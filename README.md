This is a CRUD, MVC app using Sinatra. A User can create an account, then proceed to log animal encounters and all related details as well as see the encounters of others through the main feed. A User can create, read, update and delete a Log. As well as have a collection of them. They are not allowed to do this with any logs which do not belong to them.
